# PhoneVerificationSystem


Creating a phone number verification system using Spring Boot and the Twilio API involves several steps. This README documentation will guide you through the process of building such a system. This system will enable you to send verification codes to users' phone numbers and verify them when users enter the received code.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
Java Development Kit (JDK): You need Java installed on your machine. You can download and install it from Oracle's website.

**Spring Boot:** Familiarity with Spring Boot is essential. You can learn more about Spring Boot at spring.io.

**Twilio Account:** Sign up for a Twilio account if you don't have one already at Twilio.

**Twilio Account SID and Auth Token:** After creating a Twilio account, obtain your Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console.

**Twilio Phone Number:** Purchase a Twilio phone number from the Twilio Console.

## Step 1: Set up a Spring Boot Project
1. Add the Twilio Java SDK to your project by including the following dependency in your pom.xml:

XML:

```Java
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.twilio.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>twilio</artifactId>
    <version>8.26.1</version>
</dependency>
```
2. Create a Twilio configuration class to hold your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token. Inject these values from your application.properties file.

JAVA: 
```Java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

import com.twilio.Twilio;

@Configuration
public class TwilioConfig {

    @Value("${twilio.accountSid}")
    private String accountSid;

    @Value("${twilio.authToken}")
    private String authToken;

    @Bean
    public void initTwilio() {
        Twilio.init(accountSid, authToken);
    }
}
```
3. Implement the logic to send SMS verification codes using Twilio. Create a service class that utilizes the Twilio API to send SMS messages.

## Step 3: Generate and Store Verification Codes

1. Generate random verification codes when a user requests a verification code.

2. Store these codes in a database along with the user's phone number.

3. Send the verification code to the user's phone number using Twilio.

## Step 4: Verify Verification Codes
1. Implement an endpoint that allows users to submit the verification code they received.

2. Compare the submitted code with the one stored in the database.

3. Mark the phone number as verified if the codes match.

## Step 5: Test Your System
1. Test your phone number verification system thoroughly, including edge cases and error handling.

2. Monitor your Twilio usage and billing as you may incur costs for sending SMS messages.

## Step 6: Deployment
1. Deploy your Spring Boot application to your preferred hosting environment (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or a dedicated server).

2. Configure your production database and Twilio credentials in your production environment.

3. Ensure proper security measures are in place to protect user data and API keys.

# Conclusion

You have now successfully built a phone number verification system using Spring Boot and the Twilio API. This system allows you to send and verify phone number verification codes, enhancing the security of user accounts or interactions in your application. Make sure to keep your dependencies and libraries updated for security and performance reasons.

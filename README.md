# phoneVerificationSystem


Creating a phone number verification system using Spring Boot and the Twilio API involves several steps. This README documentation will guide you through the process of building such a system. This system will enable you to send verification codes to users' phone numbers and verify them when users enter the received code.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
Java Development Kit (JDK): You need Java installed on your machine. You can download and install it from Oracle's website.

**Spring Boot:** Familiarity with Spring Boot is essential. You can learn more about Spring Boot at spring.io.

**Twilio Account:** Sign up for a Twilio account if you don't have one already at Twilio.

**Twilio Account SID and Auth Token:** After creating a Twilio account, obtain your Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console.

**Twilio Phone Number:** Purchase a Twilio phone number from the Twilio Console.
